# Installing Ronin on Fedora

## Copy/Paste Instructions

sudo gem install ronin
```

## Detailed Breakdown

{% include install/build_deps.md %}

{% include install/ruby.md %}

`ruby-bundled-gems` is required for `net/ftp`, `net/imap`, `net/pop`, and
`net/smtp`. For some reason Fedora's `ruby` package does not automatically
install the `ruby-bundled-gems` package as a dependency of `ruby`.

{% include install/runtime_deps.md %}

```shell
sudo dnf install -y git zip
```

{% include install/ronin.md %}

{% include install/post_install.md %}

{% include install/troubleshooting.md %}

If you get an exception saying `cannot load such file -- net/ftp` when trying to
run `ronin irb` or requiring `ronin/support` in Ruby, this is because the
Fedora `ruby-bundled-gems` rpm package isn't installed. You can fix this by
running:

```shell
sudo dnf install -y ruby-bundled-gems
```
